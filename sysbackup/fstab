# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# See the manpage fstab(5) for more information.
#
# NOTE: The root filesystem should have a pass number of either 0 or 1.
#       All other filesystems should have a pass number of 0 or greater than 1.
#
# NOTE: Even though we list ext4 as the type here, it will work with ext2/ext3
#       filesystems.  This just tells the kernel to use the ext4 driver.
#
# NOTE: You can use full paths to devices like /dev/sda3, but it is often
#       more reliable to use filesystem labels or UUIDs. See your filesystem
#       documentation for details on setting a label. To obtain the UUID, use
#       the blkid(8) command.

# <fs>			<mountpoint>	<type>		<opts>		<dump> <pass>
